Instructors/mentors:

This is to be used as a guide for running the PCT training files. Included is a general breakdown of how the file runs
and what to expect. If there are any issues/problems with the files, please email ta@vzdc.org with the file name, so it
can be fixed. 

Remember for ALL departures, the system defaults the initial altitude to 7000, so it must be changed before clearing them 
for takeoff, or they'll blow the initial altitude.

CHP files:
3/13/16: TERPZ/CONLE departures updated. ANTHM arrival west ops waypoints corrected.

CHP W Easier Intro SFv3: (3/13/16) 

Landing 33L/33R, departing 28/33R. No satellite ops or VFR.

17 BWI arrivals, 10 BWI departures. 7 DCA arrivals (3 SKILZ, 2 CLIPR, 2 DEALE). 2 DCA departures (1 to JERES, 1 to PALEO 
at 9k). 
Workload: light to moderate, occasionally difficult. 

Designed to be a true "first radar session" file, with a slower pace and less traffic than the W medium file. 
Removed a few aircraft from each arrival stream and extended out the delay times, so it should be a very gentle 
intro file so the students can feel out the airspace and the procedures. 

DCA landing NORTH. 

1 turboprop arrival for 33R, not til later in the file, for the student to play with. 

Update 1/20/16: increased intervals for arrivals.

CHP E Easier Intro SFv2: (3/13/16) 

Landing 10/15L, departing 15L/15R. No satellite ops or VFR.

16 BWI arrivals, 10 BWI departures, 2 DCA departures (same as above), and several DCA arrivals. 
Workload: light to moderate, occasionally difficult. 

Same rundown as W easier intro file, just in east ops. 

DCA landing SOUTH.

CHP W Medium SFv3 (replaces Intro V1): (3/13/16) 

Landing 33L/33R, departing 28/33R. No satellite ops. 

23 arrivals, 10 departures, 9 overflights (2 CLIPR, 2 DEALE, 3 SKILZ, 1 DCA dep going to JERES, 1 DCA dep going to 
PALEO at 9k). 1 VFR transition NW to SE. 1 VFR arrival from east. Steady but not overwhelming pace, instructors can 
modify delays if needed. A bit quicker tempo with more traffic than the easier intro. 

Workload: Moderate to heavy, occasionally to mostly difficult.

DCA arrivals are set to DCA landing NORTH, brief student on MTV flow before start of session.

Updated arrivals to current numbers. ANTHM2 track changed from ANTHM1, OLBAY intersection not in sector file, used 
another close WP but should simulate it nicely enough. Also have a few RIPKN arrivals just for giggles. 

Added a couple prop/turboprop arrivals so students can sequence for 33L and 33R approaches. 

Added additional departures, updated routes and added a few CONLE departures. Aircraft that are r/v DAILY should 
make the turn at 3DME now and fly heading 150 until the student sends them to DAILY. No FIXETs. 

Update 1/20/16: intervals tweaked a bit.

CHP E Medium SFv2: (3/13/16) 

Landing 10/15L, departing 15L/15R. 

Workload: moderate to heavy, occasionally to mostly difficult. 

Same as the west ops medium file, just in east flow. Also added a DCA arrival on V308 that needs to be vectored to DEALE 
(is set in waypoints to send direct to DEALE). 

DCA landing SOUTH.

CHP W with Satellites SFv2: (3/13/16) 

BWI: Landing 33L, dep 28. W29: arr/dep 29, DMW: arr/dep 34. 

Updated version of old CHP W intro file.

Workload: Moderate to heavy. Occasional to very difficult. 

19 BWI arr (1 VFR), 2 DMW arr, 1 W29 arr, 6 BWI deps, 1 DMW dep, 1 W29 dep, 1 VFR transition (N to S, will roam through east side 
of finals and through DAILY gate) VFR aircraft will have no info, needs to have strip made. Couple SKILZ/DEALE arrivals.
Obligatory DCA departure headed to JERES, and another going to PALEO at 5k.

DCA landing NORTH. 



_______________________________________




NEC_CLIPR and NEC_DEALE (1/28/16)

Situation file designed for CHP controllers working the Northeastern Corridor event, can be used anytime though. 
Designed to be sector dependent (WOOLY for CLIPR file, BWIFS/GRACO for DEALE file). Not both at the same time. 

Occasional to mostly difficult, moderate traffic load. 

Mainly designed to evaluate sequencing skills (altitude, speed restriction, etc) as well as hold clearances. 

DCA set up to be landing SOUTH. 

NO BWI arrival traffic. 

CLIPR: 12 CLIPR arrivals, 5 SKILS arrivals to be blended, 2 coming down MXE V378 BAL. 
Holds in file at SKILS, TRISH, and ENSUE (on V378) as published. Pretty high intensity file.

DEALE: 9 DEALE arrivals, 4 coming down ATR V308 BILIT, and 6 overflow's from the north sent by WOOLY due to heavy
traffic. 

Holds in file at BILIT as published.

Non-DEALE arrivals will track V308 all the way to OTT. DEALE is next fix after OTT in their sim route to make life easier
to send direct if needed. 
WOOLY overflows will enter on a 170 heading, level at 10k (jets) or 6k (props). Jets can be assigned the DEALE arrival
starting at BILIT if the student so desires (set in the file), but will track way south before sequencing to BILIT, so 
they need to be given direct to BILIT and will join. This file might be harder than CLIPR.

SHD Files:

3/13/16: WOOLY1 departure added. CAVLR3 updated. 
PRIVO, DELRO, SEG, and MAPEL arrivals updated w/ correct fixes.
No holds in any of the SHD files right now. My next project.-SF

SHD N easier SFv1 (3/13/16)

Landing 1L/C/R, Departing 1C/30

18 arrivals, 13 departures, with a little bit of everything. 

Workload: Easy to moderate, occasionally difficult. 

Easy intro for SHD N ops airspace. 
No VFR, no satellite traffic. Each charted arrival (except WIGOL) has at least 1 arrival. 
HYPER/LEGGO arrivals will all transition down the east side (1R). MAPEL arrivals will transition down the west side (1C/1L) 
Of course, they can give them any runway but they have to fly that transition. Brief the student before the session. 
BULRN arrivals will fly a ~270 heading after departures, and expect radar vectors to CIIVL (or better in practice, BULRN, 
since CIIVL sits 8 miles south of the 1C extended centerline and can get in the way if not climbed fast enough.)
JCOBY departures will fly heading (roughly) as per SID and expect vectors to RIGNZ. Same with MCRAY/JERES RNAV deps.
CAP9 will be roughly on heading per tower SOP, need manual steering through charlie gate on our end. 
1L is enabled as an arrival runway for this file if the student needs/wants it for some reason. 
All visual or ILS approaches, no aircraft are programmed to run any of the RNAV (although I guess you could do vectors to 
final if you wanted to)

SHD S easier SFv1 (3/13/16)

Landing 19L/C/R, departing 19L/30

19 arrivals, 13 departures. 

Workload: easy to moderate, occasionally difficult

Easier intro for SHD S ops airspace. No VFR, no satellite, all visual or ILS (unless vector to final for RNAV). 
No WIGOL arrival. 
HYPER arrivals will be on 19L transition. MAPEL/LEGGO arrivals are on 19C transition. 
CAP9 departures off of 19L will fly heading 250-ish per tower SOP, need vector/manual steering through charlie gate, 
cannot be sent direct SWANN on our end.

SHD N Medium SFv1 (replaces SHD N Intro SFv3): (3/13/16)

Landing 1L/C/R, Departing 1C/30

27 arrivals, 13 departures, with a good mix of jet, turboprop, and GA prop.

Workload: Moderate to heavy. Occasional to very difficult depending on how you tweak it. 

Increased tempo from easier file, a more realistic scenario of IAD arrival/departures. Student should already have good foundation w/ CHP cert. 
No VFR, no satellite traffic. Each charted arrival (except WIGOL) has at least 1 arrival. 
HYPER/LEGGO arrivals will all transition down the east side (1R). MAPEL arrivals will transition down the west side (1C/1L) 
Of course, they can give them any runway but they have to fly that transition. Brief the student before the session.

SHD S medium SFv1 (replaces SHD S intro SFv1): (3/13/16)

Landing 19L/C/R, Departing 19L/30

27 Arrivals, 13 Departures, same general variation as N intro.

Workload: Moderate to heavy, occasional to very difficult. 

Very similar speed and flow as N medium. No VFR, no satellite, all visual or ILS (unless vector to final for RNAV). 
No WIGOL arrival. 
HYPER arrivals will be on 19L transition. MAPEL/LEGGO arrivals are on 19C transition. 
CAP9 departures off of 19L will fly heading 250-ish per tower SOP, need vector/manual steering through charlie gate,

SHD N satellites SFv1: (3/13/16)

IAD Landing 1C/R, departing 1C.
HEF landing/departing 34R
JYO landing/departing 17 (ILS/RNAV 17 in use for IAPs)

IAD: 10 arrivals, 13 departures
HEF: 6 arrivals  4 departures (1 VFR dep SE bound)
---(HEF arrivals: some VFR, some IFR. One to the north thats VFR (N737XF), set up to go over IAD, can either pick up IFR 
---and shoot RNAV 34R or just be a class B transition and go to HEF. VFR to the south (N907LF) that can do the same).
JYO: 4 arrivals, 3 departures (1 VFR to the north that can just be a distraction or can get FF, 2 IFR)
---(JYO arrivals: 1 to the west is VFR, can use as B transition and landing or can pick up and shoot RNAV/ILS 17. Notes in 
---remarks section show what approach they're wishing for. Also one to the S that is VFR B transition, set to track
---BRV to BARIN to AML to JYO. Should make some of the HEF arrivals interesting. RNAV 17 also has the hold in the file
---if wanted/needed)

Workload: moderate, occasional to very difficult. 

Slowed down IAD, but a good bit of VFR and IFR into the satellites. Added a JRV sector to open for handoffs headed that way.
Tried to set it up as "suicide" ops at JYO, with departures off of 35, but no luck.

MTV files:

3/16/16: MTV S departures file added. 

____________________________________________


MTV N Intro SF V1: (1/26/16)

Landing 1, departing 1/33, VKX landing 6. (Can use 33 as arrival if you really want to do the work, although there's only 
maybe 1 or 2 that could take 33)

17 arrivals, 7 departures, 1 satellite arrival (VKX), 3 BWI arrivals (2 RAVNN, 1 RIPKN)

Workload: moderate, occasionally difficult. 

BWI landing WEST (brief student)

Updated RR N Intro file, w/ BILIT arrivals changed to DEALE, and updated a few other little things. Spaced out the timing 
a bit more as well from the original file. 



_____________________________________


MTV S Intro SF V1: (1/26/16)

Landing/departing 19/15. VKX landing 6. 

21 arrivals, 8 departures , 2 satellite arrivals (VKX), 3 BWI arrivals (2 RAVNN, 1 RIPKN)

Workload: moderate to heavy, occasional to mostly difficult.

BWI landing EAST (brief student)

Updated RR S Intro file w/ BILIT changed to DEALE, and some other tweaking. 
CLIPR/SKILZ/DEALE arrivals will track a 325 heading after MEGGS well past NAYES if the student doesnt turn them.
CAPSS/IRONS will do the same with an extended waypoint to keep the track. 
FERGI was added as a last fix to CLIPR/SKILZ/DEALE/CAPSS/IRONS/NUMMY arrivals to make life easier for the operator
to get aircraft inbound. Also allows student to clear them direct FERGI and clear them for the RNAV if desired. 
Runway 15 added, so pretty much all DCA aircraft can just be given the "ILS 15" command and they'll track down the river. 
If they land on 15....who cares?

MTV S departures SFv1: (3/16/16)

Departing 19/15 (DCA), 30 (DCA). DCA landing south.  

22 DCA departures, 4 IAD departures, 6 DCA arrivals. 

Workload: moderate, occasionally difficult.

Departure file to orient students/visitors/etc to DCA departure flow. Multiple different departures including all the RNAV's
and several NATNL departures requiring radar vectors. Also a few FRDMM arrivals (can use for missed approaches) and some CAPSS 
arrivals (to show need to restrict to 5000 initially until clear of arrival stream). Also 4 IAD departures on the JCOBY 
departure to highlight their climbout. JCOBY departures will fly the 320 heading per the DP until you turn them direct RIGNZ 
and climb them to 10k.
